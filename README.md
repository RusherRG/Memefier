# Memefier

A Chrome Extension which Replaces all the images on a webpage with Memes on the click of a button. Just wanted to try making a chrome extension for once.

## Setup

- Clone the Repo
- Open <a href="chrome://extensions/">chrome://extensions/</a> in a new tab
- Turn On the developer mode
- Click on Load Unpacked and select the locally cloned Repo and Voila you are done
